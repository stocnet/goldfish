## Description

The `{goldfish}` package offers a collection of tools designed for applying
statistical models to dynamic network data.
It primarily focus on models for relational event data, namely,
sequences of interactions between actors or entities within a network,
enriched by fine-grained time-stamps information.
Relational event data emerge in various domains,
such as automatically collected data about interactions in
communication and social media research,
social science studies using social sensors,
and archival network studies that provide in-depth details regarding
the timing or sequence of relational actions between nodes.

Currently, the package includes the following models:

- **Dynamic Network Actor Models (DyNAM)**: Investigate relational event models
  as an actor-oriented decision process [@stad2017interaction]. 
  - *rate*: Actors compete for creating the next relational event.
  - *choice*: The active actor choose the receiver of the event.
  - *choice_coordination*: The creation of coordination ties as a two-sided
    process [@Stadtfeld2017Coordination]
- **Dynamic Network Actor Models for interactions (DyNAMi)**:
  Investigate dynamics of conversation groups and interpersonal interaction in
  different social contexts from an actor-oriented perspective 
  [@Hoffman2020].
  - *rate*: Actors compete for joining or leaving groups.
  - *choice*: The active actor choose the group to join.
- **Relational Event Models (REM)**: Investigate relational event models
  as a tie-oriented process [@butts2008relational].

## Installation

You can install `{goldfish}` directly from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=goldfish):

``` r
install.packages("goldfish")
```

To install the development version from GitHub, use the
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package:

- For latest stable version: 
`remotes::install_github("stocnet/goldfish", build_vignettes = TRUE)`
- For latest development version: 
`remotes::install_github("stocnet/goldfish@develop", build_vignettes = TRUE)`

Or by downloading and install the latest binary releases for all major OSes
-- Windows, Mac, and Linux -- can be found 
[here](https://github.com/stocnet/goldfish/releases).

### Installing OpenMP on Mac OSX

In some cases, you may get an error that does not allow installation of 
`{goldfish}` from source on Mac OSX versions, including under R 4.0.0.
The error may relate to compiling the parts of `{goldfish}` that are written
in C++, or whether OpenMP (for parallelisation) can be found.

Many installation woes can be solved by directing R to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed `gcc`.
An updated setting up instructions thanks to \@timonelmer are available [here](https://github.com/stocnet/goldfish/blob/main/.github/OpenMP_mac.md).

More details can be found [here](https://medium.com/biosyntax/following-up-library-dependency-when-compiling-r-packages-89f191b9f227) (Thank you \@Knieps for identifying this.).

## Usage

Below is a quick-start guide to using the `{goldfish}` package.
The dataset used in this example is an abbreviated version of the
MIT Social Evolution data (`?Social_Evolution`).

### Define data objects and link events

The main data objects required for the analysis are the node set(s) 
`defineNodes()` and network(s) `defineNetwork()`.
The node set object contains labels and attributes of the actors in the network.
In contrast, a network object contains the information of past relational events
between actors.
By default, `defineNetwork()` constructs an empty matrix, its dimensions
defined by the length of the nodeset(s).
Data frames containing event data that modify these data objects can be
linked to them using the `linkEvents()` method.

```{r}
library(goldfish)
data("Social_Evolution")

callNetwork <- defineNetwork(nodes = actors, directed = TRUE) |> # 1
  linkEvents(changeEvent = calls, nodes = actors) # 2

```

The events data frame, which indicates the time-varying attributes in
the node set, contains the following columns:

- `time`: The time when the attribute changes,
  either a `numeric` or `POSIXct` value.
- `node`: The node for which the attribute changes, a `character` value
  that matches the `label` variable in the node set.
- `replace`: The new value of the attribute, a `numeric` value.

The events data frame that details the relational events between actors
contains the following columns:

- `time`: The time when the event occurred,
  either a `numeric` or `POSIXct` value.
- `sender`: The actor initiating the event, a `character` value
  that matches the `label` variable in the node set.
- `receiver`: The actor receiving the event, a `character` value
  that matches the `label` variable in the node set.
- `increment` or `replace`: A `numeric` value indicating either the increment
  that the relational event represents or the new value.

### Define dependent events

The final step in defining the data objects is to identify the dependent events.
Here we would like to model as the dependent variable the calls
between individuals.
We specify the event data frame and the node set.

```{r}
callsDependent <- defineDependentEvents(
  events = calls, nodes = actors,
  defaultNetwork = callNetwork
  )
```

### Model specification and estimation

We specify our model using the standard R formula format like:

`goldfish_dependent ~ effects(process_state_element)`

We can see which effects are currently available and how to specify them here:


```r
vignette("goldfishEffects")
```

Now to estimate this model, we use the `?estimate` function.


```{r}
mod00Rate <- estimate(
  callsDependent ~ indeg + outdeg,
  model = "DyNAM", subModel = "rate"
)

summary(mod00Rate)

mod00Choice <- estimate(
  callsDependent ~ inertia + recip + trans,
  model = "DyNAM", subModel = "choice"
)
summary(mod00Choice)
```
