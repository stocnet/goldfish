\title{Calculation for estimating an DyNAM choice model}
\usage{
estimate_DyNAM_choice(parameters, dep_event_mat, stat_mat_init,
  stat_mat_update, stat_mat_update_pointer, presence2_init,
  presence2_update, presence2_update_pointer, n_actors_1, n_actors_2,
  twomode_or_reflexive, impute)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{An n_parameters by 1 matrix, which is the input parameter}

\item{dep_event_mat}{An 2 by n_events matrix, the (1,n) entry is the sender of n-th event,
and the (2,n) entry is the receiver of the n-th event.}

\item{stat_mat_init}{An n_actor1*n_actor2 by n_parameters matrix. It is the initialization of the statistics matrix.
The initial value of k-th effect for the actor1-actor2 pair (i,j) is recorded in
the ((i-1)*n_actor2 + j,k) entry of stat_mat_init.}

\item{stat_mat_update}{An matrix with four rows, which records the updates of the statistics matrix through all dependent events.
The following is an example.
\tabular{rrrrr}{
  0 \tab 2 \tab 0 \tab 9 \tab 9\cr
  2 \tab 1 \tab 5 \tab 4 \tab 3\cr
  3 \tab 5 \tab 5 \tab  0 \tab 5\cr
  1.2 \tab 3.5 \tab 2.5 \tab 9.23 \tab 2.8\cr
}
Each column represents an update. For example the first column means replacing the value of the (3+1)-th effect
for the actor1-actor2 pair(0+1,2+1) by 1.2. The +1 is due to the difference between the numberings in R and C.}

\item{stat_mat_update_pointer}{An n_events by 1 matrix that record which update belongs to which dependent event.
Suppose that the first three elements are (10,11,15). Then the first 10 colums of stat_mat_update is the update for the first event,
the 11th column is  the update for the second event, and the 12th to 15th columns are the updates for the third event.}

\item{presence2_init}{An n_actors2 by 1 matrix, which records the initial presence of each actor2.
If the i-th actor2 is not present in the begining then the i-th entry of presence2_init is 0, otherwise it's 1.}

\item{presence2_update}{An matrix with two rows, which record the updates of the presence of actor2 through all events.
The following is an example.
\tabular{rrrrr}{
  0 \tab 3 \tab 4 \tab 9 \tab 20\cr
  1 \tab 0 \tab 1 \tab 0 \tab 0\cr
}
Each column represents an update. For example the first column means the 0+1-th actor2 becomes present.
And the second column means the
the 3+1 th actor2 becomes absent. The +1 is due to the difference between the numberings in R and C.}

\item{presence2_update_pointer}{An n_events by 1 matrix that record which update belongs to which (dependent+ rightcensored) event.
The structure is similar to stat_mat_update_pointer.}

\item{n_actors_1}{An integer which is the number of actor1}

\item{n_actors_2}{An integer which is the number of actor2}

\item{twomode_or_reflexive}{An boolean variable. If it's true, then the model is two-model
or we consider the reflexive effect (that's the value in the diagonal entries of the statistics matrix).}

\item{impute}{An boolean variable. If it true, the function does the imputation for missing values.}
}
\value{
Return a list with elements as follows.
\describe{
  \item{derivative}{An 1 by n_parameters matrix, which is the derivative of loglikelihood given the input parameter and data.}
  \item{fisher}{An n_parameters by n_parameters matrix, which is the fisher information matrix given the input parameter and data.}
  \item{logLikelihood}{An scalar, which is the loglikelihood given the input parameter and data.}
  \item{intervalLogL}{An n_events by 1 matrix,
        of which the i-th entry is the loglikelihood of the i-th event given the input parameter and data.}
}
}
\description{
Given input data, it output the derivative of the loglikelihood, the Fisher information matrix, the logLikelihood,
    and the loglikelihood of each event
