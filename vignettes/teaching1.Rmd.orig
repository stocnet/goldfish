# Step 0: Load package and data

First, we load the `goldfish` package and load the data.
The data is loaded using lazy loading, i.e., the objects are only 'promised'
for the moment, but are available in the environment to be used, and
more information will appear as you use them.
You can find out more about this dataset, its format, and its origins in
a couple of ERGM papers by callings its documentation:

```{r load, message=FALSE}
library(goldfish)
data("Social_Evolution")
# ?Social_Evolution
head(calls)
head(actors)
```

```{r mask, echo=FALSE}
#| purl = FALSE
estimate <- function(
    x,
    model = c("DyNAM", "REM", "DyNAMi"),
    subModel = c("choice", "rate", "choice_coordination"),
    estimationInit = NULL,
    preprocessingInit = NULL,
    preprocessingOnly = FALSE,
    verbose = FALSE,
    progress = FALSE) {
  
  call <- match.call(expand.dots = TRUE)
  
  if (is.null(estimationInit$engine)) {
    estimationInit <- c(estimationInit, list(engine = "gather_compute"))
  }
  
  res <- goldfish::estimate(
    x = x,
    model = model,
    subModel = subModel,
    estimationInit = estimationInit,
    preprocessingInit = preprocessingInit,
    preprocessingOnly = preprocessingOnly,
    verbose = verbose,
    progress = progress
  )
  
  res$call <- call 
  res$call[["x"]] <- res$formula

  return(res)
}
```


# Preamble: Run a quick DyNAM in five lines
We use an `R` version higher than 4.2.0 to compile the vignettes.
The native pipe operator is available in `R` from version 4.1.0.

```{r quick}
callNetwork <- make_network(nodes = actors, directed = TRUE) |> # 1
  link_events(change_events = calls, nodes = actors) # 2

# 3
callsDependent <- make_dependent_events(
  events = calls, nodes = actors,
  default_network = callNetwork
  )

# 4
mod00Rate <- estimate(
  callsDependent ~ indeg + outdeg,
  model = "DyNAM", subModel = "rate"
  )

summary(mod00Rate)

mod00Choice <- estimate(
  callsDependent ~ inertia + recip + trans,
  model = "DyNAM", subModel = "choice"
  )

summary(mod00Choice)
```

# Step 1: Create data objects

## Step 1a: Make node set(s) and attributes

We've loaded a dataset that defines its nodes and their attributes as
a data frame. Let's check what we have first.

```{r actors}
class(actors)
head(actors)
```

Note that there are four column variables: `label` the identifier, `present`,
the `floor` of residence, and `gradeType` their educational level
(1 = freshmen to 5 = graduate).
All of these columns will be recognized as individual attributes by goldfish.

We need to make them as nodes so that `goldfish` knows what to do with them.

```{r make_nodes}
actors <- make_nodes(actors)
actors
```

As you can see, the structure is the same, so we can still treat it like
a data frame, but the added class helps goldfish interpret the data frame
correctly.


## Step 1b: Make networks

Next we want to define the dyadic or network elements: calls between our actors.

```{r calls-events}
head(calls)
```

Note there are columns for `time`, `sender`, and `receiver`. `increment`
is a reserved column.

To tell goldfish this is a network, we must make it as such:
```{r hlp1, eval=FALSE}
?make_network
```

```{r call-net}
callNetwork <- make_network(nodes = actors, directed = TRUE)
```

The argument `directed` is `TRUE` by default, but we need to specify
the nodes so that `goldfish` can check for consistency and relate it to
that nodeset as needed.

```{r strNet}
callNetwork
```

Note that we have not added any network data yet. By default, `make_network()`
just constructs an empty matrix with dimensions defined by the length of the
nodeset(s).
So we have an empty network as a starting state.

Now that goldfish recognizes the matrix as a network, we can also associate
an event list that updates it.
To do this we use the `link_events()` function, which requires us to identify
a goldfish object to be updated, the events that update it and, in this case,
also the nodes that the events should relate to.
`goldfish` checks the consistency of all this information and relates these
objects to one another so that information can be called as needed.

```{r hlp2, eval=FALSE}
?link_events
```

```{r link-call-net}
callNetwork <- link_events(x = callNetwork, change_events = calls, nodes = actors)
callNetwork
```

### Task

You should now be able to do the same with the friendship nomination
network/event list.
See the familiar columns `time`, `sender`, and `receiver`.
The new column, `replace`, is an alternative treatment to `increment`.
When an event occurs, goldfish will replace the value in
the relevant cell with the value in this column instead of incrementing it.
Friendship is thus a binary network.

```{r frdshp-net}
head(friendship)
friendshipNetwork <- make_network(nodes = actors, directed = TRUE)
friendshipNetwork <- link_events(
  x = friendshipNetwork,
  change_events = friendship,
  nodes = actors
  )
friendshipNetwork
```

## Step 1c: Make dependent events

The final step in defining the data objects is to identify the dependent events.
Here we would like to model as the dependent variable the calls
between individuals.
We specify the event list and the node list.

```{r hlp3, eval=FALSE}
?make_dependent_events
```

```{r call-dep-events}
callsDependent <- make_dependent_events(
  events = calls, nodes = actors,
  default_network = callNetwork
  )
callsDependent
```

### Intermediate step: Visualization

While not a required part of the modeling process,
we highly recommend the visualization of your data for analytic and
diagnostic purposes.
`goldfish` includes wrappers for base `R` commands to help extract monadic
and dyadic information for certain time points, `?as.data.frame.nodes.goldfish`
and `?as.matrix.network.goldfish`.

We can use these functions to visually compare our network at two (or more)
different time periods using `migraph`. See the `migraph` package documentation
for additional information about network visualization.

```{r plot-teaching1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
library(migraph)
# The network at the beginning
callNetworkBgn <- as.matrix(callNetwork)
graphr(callNetworkBgn, labels = FALSE, layout = "fr")

# The network at half time
callNetworkHlf <- as.matrix(
  callNetwork,
  time = calls$time[floor(nrow(calls) / 2)]
) |>
  as_igraph() |>
  add_node_attribute("floor", actors$floor)

graphr(callNetworkHlf, labels = FALSE, layout = "fr") +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = as.factor(floor)), size = 2, show.legend = FALSE)

# The network at the end
callNetworkEnd <- as.matrix(callNetwork, time = max(calls$time) + 1) |>
  as_igraph() |>
  add_node_attribute("floor", actors$floor)

graphr(callNetworkEnd, labels = FALSE, layout = "fr") +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = as.factor(floor)), size = 2, show.legend = FALSE)


# The tie strength at the end
table(as.matrix(callNetwork, time = max(calls$time) + 1))
```

# Step 2: Specify and estimate model

The second step is to specify and fit a model to this data.
This step can be broken up into several stages:

-   **Step 2a**. *Formula*: Specify a model formula from the effects and
  variables available

-   **Step 2b**. *Preprocessing*: Calculate the change statistics associated
  with these effects

-   **Step 2c**. *Estimation*: Fit an appropriate model to these statistics

However, in goldfish we also have the option of accelerating this process and
using memory more efficiently by combining these three sub-steps in one.
Nonetheless, it can be helpful to think of 2a separately, and
recognize steps 2b and 2c as goldfish does them.

## Step 2a. Formula

We specify our model using the standard R formula format like:

`goldfish_dependent ~ effects(process_state_element)`

We can see which effects are currently available and how to specify them here:

```{r effects, eval=FALSE}
vignette("goldfishEffects")
```

Let's start with the simplest model we can imagine:

```{r simple-formula}
simpleFormulaChoice <- callsDependent ~ tie(friendshipNetwork)
```

What are we testing here?
Do individuals call their friends more than non-friends?

## Step 2b and 2c. Preprocessing and Estimation

Now to estimate this model, we use the `?estimate` function.
For now, only need to worry about the `formula` and the `model`,
`subModel` type (DyNAM-choice).

```{r simple-choice}
mod01Choice <- estimate(
  simpleFormulaChoice,
  model = "DyNAM", subModel = "choice"
  )
summary(mod01Choice)
```

Ok, as fascinating as that was, perhaps we can test how robust
this finding is in the presence of plausible controls.

```{r  complex-choice}
complexFormulaChoice <-
  callsDependent ~ inertia(callNetwork) + recip(callNetwork) +
                   tie(friendshipNetwork) + recip(friendshipNetwork) +
                   same(actors$gradeType) + same(actors$floor)

mod02Choice <- estimate(
  complexFormulaChoice,
  model = "DyNAM", subModel = "choice"
  )
summary(mod02Choice)
```

### Rate model

How do individual properties affect the rate of action of individuals?
(Step 1 of the model)

Let us again define a simple formula that only depends on individuals' degree
in the friendship network

```{r simple-rate}
simpleFormulaRate <- callsDependent ~ indeg(friendshipNetwork)
mod01Rate <- estimate(
  simpleFormulaRate,
  model = "DyNAM", subModel = "rate"
  )
```

#### Remark:

Sometimes, the default values for the algorithm are not enough
to reach convergence. 
We can remedy this by increasing the number of iterations:

```{r estimate-init}
mod01Rate <- estimate(
  simpleFormulaRate,
  model = "DyNAM", subModel = "rate",
  estimationInit = list(maxIterations = 40)
  )
summary(mod01Rate)
```

What if we include additional structural effects?
Let us add the in and out degree of the nodes in the call network

```{r complex-rate}
complexFormulaRate <-
  callsDependent ~ indeg(callNetwork) + outdeg(callNetwork) +
                   indeg(friendshipNetwork)

mod02Rate <- estimate(complexFormulaRate, model = "DyNAM", subModel = "rate")
summary(mod02Rate)
```

#### Right-censored intervals

Recall that it is important to add a time intercept when estimating models with
right-censored intervals (as discussed in Stadtfeld & Block, 2017).
Adding an intercept is as easy as including a 1 to the formula:

```{r intcpt-rate}
interceptFormulaRate <-
  callsDependent ~ 1 + indeg(callNetwork) + outdeg(callNetwork) +
                   indeg(friendshipNetwork)

mod03Rate <- estimate(interceptFormulaRate, model = "DyNAM", subModel = "rate")
summary(mod03Rate)
```

Note that $1 / \exp({\beta_{intercept}})$ is the waiting time
without any covariates, or how long it takes to make the next phone call
if everything else is set to 0.
Therefore, the larger the intercept the shorter the waiting time.
For example, an intercept of -14 means a waiting time of
$1 / e^{-14} = 334$ hours. 
The baseline waiting time between two events in hours:

```{r waiting-time}
mod03RateCoef <- coef(mod03Rate)
1 / exp(mod03RateCoef[["Intercept"]]) / 3600
# or days:
1 / exp(mod03RateCoef[["Intercept"]]) / 86400

# But what if it is not just a random call?
# Expected waiting time of those who have five outgoing call ties
# (five different actors)
1 / exp(
  mod03RateCoef[["Intercept"]] + mod03RateCoef[["outdeg"]] * 5
  ) / 3600
# Expected waiting time of those who have five outgoing and incoming call ties
# (five different actors)
1 / exp(
  mod03RateCoef[["Intercept"]] +
    mod03RateCoef[["outdeg"]] * 5 +
    mod03RateCoef[["indeg"]] * 5
  ) / 3600
```

### Windows

Remember our `callNetwork` process state accumulates actions in time,
but some older actions may no longer be relevant to current action. 
Let's see whether it is really just recent partners that matter
by adding extra effects with a window of... how long?
Let us try 5 minutes $= 5 * 60 = 300s$

```{r windows-rate}
windowFormulaRate <-
  callsDependent ~ 1 + indeg(callNetwork) + outdeg(callNetwork) +
                   indeg(callNetwork, window = 300) +
                   outdeg(callNetwork, window = 300) +
                   indeg(friendshipNetwork)

mod04Rate <- estimate(windowFormulaRate, model = "DyNAM", subModel = "rate")
summary(mod04Rate)
```

Of course, you can also add windows to the choice formula!

```{r windows-choice}
windowFormulaChoice <-
  callsDependent ~ inertia(callNetwork) + recip(callNetwork) +
                   inertia(callNetwork, window = 300) +
                   recip(callNetwork, window = 300) +
                   tie(friendshipNetwork) + recip(friendshipNetwork) +
                   same(actors$gradeType) + same(actors$floor)

mod03Choice <- estimate(windowFormulaChoice,
                         model = "DyNAM", subModel = "choice")
summary(mod03Choice)
```

All this shows you that you can specify different formula
for the rate and choice components of the model.
This is a key advantage of the DyNAM!

When comparing the information criteria (AIC / BIC) of the different models,
we see that the time windows explain a lot

```{r aic}
# Compare different specifications of the subModel = "choice"
AIC(mod02Choice, mod03Choice)

# Compare different specifications of the subModel = "rate"
AIC(mod03Rate, mod04Rate)
```

### REM with `goldfish`

`goldfish` does not only run DyNAMs; it also runs REMs (Butts, 2008).
We can now also run REMs using the right-censored intervals as introduced in Stadtfeld & Block (2017).
An equivalent model specification to the DyNAM model we estimated above,
including the rate and choice sub-models, is:


```{r rem}
allFormulaREM <-
  callsDependent ~ 
    1 + indeg(callNetwork, type = "ego") + outdeg(callNetwork, type = "ego") +
    indeg(friendshipNetwork, type = "ego") +
    inertia(callNetwork) + recip(callNetwork) +
    inertia(callNetwork, window = 300) + recip(callNetwork, window = 300) +
    tie(friendshipNetwork) + recip(friendshipNetwork) +
    same(actors$gradeType) + same(actors$floor)
```

And we can estimate this model, to speed up estimation, we can use any of the
two `C` implementations of the estimation algorithm.
Setting the option `engine` on the `estimationInit` argument, we can choose
which version of the `C` code to use.
`"default_c"` implements the same algorithm as
the default one implemented in plain `R` code that reduces the memory use
by exploiting the sparsity of the dyads that change the effects' statistics
after each event.
`"gather_compute"` implements a version with an overhead of memory use,
representing the data in a more usual tabular way but reducing time estimation.

```{r rem-gather, eval=FALSE}
mod01REM <- estimate(
  allFormulaREM, model = "REM",
  estimationInit = list(initialDamping = 40, engine = "default_c")
  )
```

```{r rem-c}
mod01REM <- estimate(
  allFormulaREM, model = "REM",
  estimationInit = list(engine = "gather_compute")
  )

summary(mod01REM)
```
